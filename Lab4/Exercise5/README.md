>Exercise 5. Apply the big kernel lock as described above, by calling lock_kernel() and unlock_kernel() at the proper locations.
```
In i386_init(), acquire the lock before the BSP wakes up the other CPUs.
In mp_main(), acquire the lock after initializing the AP, and then call sched_yield() to start running environments on this AP.
In trap(), acquire the lock when trapped from user mode. To determine whether a trap happened in user mode or in kernel mode, check the low bits of the tf_cs.
In env_run(), release the lock right before switching to user mode. Do not do that too early or too late, otherwise you will experience races or deadlocks.
```

	// Initialize the console.
	// Can't call cprintf until after we do this!
	cons_init();

	cprintf("6828 decimal is %o octal!\n", 6828);

	// Lab 2 memory management initialization functions
	mem_init();

	// Lab 3 user environment initialization functions
	env_init();
	trap_init();

	// Lab 4 multiprocessor initialization functions
	mp_init();
	lapic_init();

	// Lab 4 multitasking initialization functions
	pic_init();

	// Acquire the big kernel lock before waking up APs
	// Your code here:
	lock_kernel();

	// Starting non-boot CPUs
	boot_aps();

	// Don't touch -- used by grading script!
	ENV_CREATE(TEST, ENV_TYPE_USER);

	// Touch all you want.

#endif // TEST*

	// Schedule and run the first user environment!
	sched_yield();
