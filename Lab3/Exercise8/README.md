>Exercise 8. Add the required code to the user library, then boot your kernel. You should see user/hello print "hello, world" and then print "i am environment 00001000". user/hello then attempts to "exit" by calling sys_env_destroy() (see lib/libmain.c and lib/exit.c). Since the kernel currently only supports one user environment, it should report that it has destroyed the only environment and then drop into the kernel monitor. You should be able to get make grade to succeed on the hello test.

# 代码

```
void
libmain(int argc, char **argv)
{
	// set thisenv to point at our Env structure in envs[].
	// LAB 3: Your code here.
	envid_t envid = sys_getenvid();    
  	thisenv = envs + ENVX(envid);      //获取Env结构指针

	// save the name of the program so that panic() can use it
	if (argc > 0)
		binaryname = argv[0];

	// call user main routine
	umain(argc, argv);

	// exit gracefully
	exit();
}
```

注意 envs 数组在 lib/entry.S 的数据段中初始化。
```
.data
// Define the global symbols 'envs', 'pages', 'uvpt', and 'uvpd'
// so that they can be used in C as if they were ordinary global arrays.
	.globl envs
	.set envs, UENVS
	.globl pages
	.set pages, UPAGES
	.globl uvpt
	.set uvpt, UVPT
	.globl uvpd
	.set uvpd, (UVPT+(UVPT>>12)*4)


// Entrypoint - this is where the kernel (or our parent environment)
// starts us running when we are initially loaded into a new environment.
.text
.globl _start
_start:
	// See if we were started with arguments on the stack
	cmpl $USTACKTOP, %esp
	jne args_exist

	// If not, push dummy argc/argv arguments.
	// This happens when we are loaded by the kernel,
	// because the kernel does not know about passing arguments.
	pushl $0
	pushl $0

args_exist:
	call libmain
1:	jmp 1b
```
